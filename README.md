**GOALS**
1. Determine filter values for processing images 
2. Conceptually map out how you would use CV + OpenCV libraries
3. Translate ideas to code
4. Make the robot be able to autonomously place a hatch or cargo
5. Make the robot be able to autonomously align
6. Make the robot be able to determine encoder values based on vision after driving off ramp

**SETUP**
1. Go to /c/Users/Public/frc2019/maven/edu/wpi/first/thirdparty/frc2019/opencv/opencv-cpp/3.4.4-4.
2. Extract the windows x84 64 file to the same folder; there should be a folder named windows.
3. Open Git Bash and run PATH=/c/Users/Public/frc2019/maven/edu/wpi/first/thirdparty/frc2019/opencv/opencv-cpp/3.4.4-4/windows/x86-64/shared:$PATH to put the native libraries into the path.
Note: You will have to run this every time you reopen the window. If you don't want to type the entire thing every time, set up an alias for it.
